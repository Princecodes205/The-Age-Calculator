## Overview

The age calculator is designed to calculate your age from your birthday to current day.
I calculates for age in years, months and days.

User is to input his/her birthdates in the input sections and click the button to display calculated age, after clicking to display age click button again to reset all values.

You can share with your friends and Enjoy üéâ

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

Basiclly what i enjoyed in this project was calling functions, although it was not new to me but i really enjoyed it and learned some new stuff from calling functions like writing more than one funtion in function and calling them a once in an event handler function.

### Continued development

I would love to continue with projects that has more complex logic than this one to improve my skills and will also learn tailwind css frame work to help in my front-end skills.
